# üó∫ devRadar

devRadar is a website and mobile software developed during the Semana Omnistack #10 from Rocketseat, with aim to find developers with the same interest in tecnologies that you.

### üíª Tech 
devRadar uses some open source projects to work properly:

  * [Node.js]
  * [Express]
  * [mongoose]
  * [react]
  * [react-native]

  
### üî® Installation 

devRadar requires [node.js] and [Expo] to run.
note: Expo must be installed on your smarthphone to see the project running on mobile.

To run this project, you must install all dependecies from web, mobile and backend running the command below in all folders, then just start the project.

```sh
$ npm install
```

after installing all dependecies run this command to start the web and mobile:

```sh
$ npm start
```

the backend must be started by the following command:

```sh
$ npm dev
```

Then devRadar web will start in localhost at:

```sh
localhost:3000
```

and the mobile will start when you open the app [Expo].
